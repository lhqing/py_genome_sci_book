## Why python?

![https://xkcd.com/353/](.gitbook/assets/python.png)

Python is simple and versatile. It's a [much more popular programming language](https://www.google.com/search?q=programming+language+popularity) than R \(the other language that's mainly used by bioinformatician and statistician\). Yet [R is still useful in many aspect](use-r-in-python/why.md),  its not hard to [integrate some open-box R packages into python](use-r-in-python/rpy2.md). For other daily works, I choose python over R.

## What do I want to write?

My experience on using python in genome science, with a focus on intermediate level python programming, and some basic introduction to genome science.

## The Intermediate Level

Above is my favorite joke about learning programming. But I guess its also right for learning anything, especially for self-learning on anything. [Introduction level materials](introduction-level-information/) are always available, especially for hot words like "python" or "genomics". Advanced level materials are usually domain-specific, and people who study that, know how to get the information. The intermediate level means the massive gap between understanding the "introduction to X" and becoming an expert. And here I want to write about my experience of passing this level. Having that said, I only consider myself at the "late-stage" of intermediate level, not a wholly expert. But I guess the "fresh experience" can sometimes be more useful than pure knowledge, just like [one of my favorite books about the learning experience](http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm).

## About me

I like learning new things, especially things that looks beautiful. Learning python is the best choice I made during my time at college. And it become more and more useful in my daily research.

For the current research, I study brain methylome at single-cell level. I didn't learn anything about neuroscience at college, but I'm really fascinated by it now. I will continue my journey on neuroscience after getting my Ph.D., no matter what aspect of it.

For enjoying life, photography! But sadly, not during this coronavirus pandemic.
